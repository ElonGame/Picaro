THINGS TO DO:
1) Change MapGenerator so that a BG and FG Tile are added to the same MapSquare
2) Remove extra stuff from MapSquare
3) Add a check/optimize the "room adding" loop, so that it won't continuously try to add a rooms if
	a) it is impossible to fit an area of that room-space into the map
	b) the likelihood of fitting another room into the map is very small by randomly picking points to start adding a room
4) Move the switch statement code in MapGenerator MakeRoom() to a separate function(s)?
5) MapGenerator.MakeRectangularRoom() is pretty large and cumbersome right now... try to optimize code; perhaps breaking function into smaller, reusable functions
	that several different room type making functions can reuse
	Parts of MakeRectangularRoom to move to separate functions:
	a) space check loop?
	b) function that generates random width/height
	c) function that adds currently being made "room" to List<List<List<Vector2>>> AreaMap.RoomSquaresList
	d) more compact function for checking if MapSquare.mapSquareStates[0] is set to BLANKSTATE (right now it's in a loop check)
	e) general function for changing MapSquare.mapSquareStates[] to different states
	f) function for checking/adding TextureNames from the TileSet this room uses 
		to MapEngine's List<string> currentMapTexturesNames (passed by ref as parameter of same name)
		and MapEngine's AreaMap currentMap.TextureNameList (passed by ref as parameter AreaMap new_map);
		*this function should add the index of the just added TileSet.TextureName to the current MapSquare
		in loop
	g) current method of added Animated titles is very cumbersome, make into separate function
	h) function that changes current MapSquare.textureName and MapSquare.(FG/BG)SourceRect
	i) **function/logic for determining which source rect in currently chosen TileSet to use
	j) ROOM vs PERIMETER check/if-else statement
	k) add animated tiles for PERIMETER mapSquares
	l) add function for checking MapSquare's state index... don't want to reference an index not there

THINGS I DID:
04APR14: (AreaMap.cs) added function to check a MapSquare flag in mapSquareStates for a particular flag/state
	public bool CheckMapSquareState(MapSquare map_square, int checked_index, MapSquareFlags checked_state) : just checks at specific index
	public bool CheckMapSquareState(MapSquare map_square, MapSquareFlags checked_state) : loops through entire MapSquare.MapSquareStates[]
24MAY14: Did alot of stuff, will update later. Added "Ideas" section.
